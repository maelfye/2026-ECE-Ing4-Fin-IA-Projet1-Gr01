# Fair Credit Scoring under Fairness Constraints

This project studies credit scoring under fairness constraints.
We compare baseline models with fairness-aware approaches
(pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and analyze
the trade-off between predictive performance, fairness, and profit.
